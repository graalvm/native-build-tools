[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The {doctitle} adds support for building and testing native images using https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven]â„¢.

For upgrading please take a look at the <<index.adoc#changelog,Changelog>>.

[[quickstart]]
== Quickstart

====
The plugin requires that you https://www.graalvm.org/latest/docs/getting-started/[setup GraalVM].

The easiest way to install GraalVM is to use the https://sdkman.io/jdks[SDKMAN!].

For other installation options, go to https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[GraalVM Downloads].

You can find full samples in https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools/tree/master/samples[the source repository].

[[configuration-registering-plugin]]
== Adding the plugin

Add the following profile to your `pom.xml` file to register the `native-maven-plugin`.

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
```xml
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>native</id>
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
            <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${native.maven.plugin.version}</version>
            <extensions>true</extensions>
            <executions>
              <execution>
                <id>build-native</id>
                <goals>
                  <goal>compile-no-fork</goal>
                </goals>
                <phase>package</phase>
              </execution>
              <execution>
                <id>test-native</id>
                <goals>
                  <goal>test</goal>
                </goals>
                <phase>test</phase>
              </execution>
            </executions>
            <configuration>
              <!-- ... -->
            </configuration>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
```

You can then build a native executable directly with Maven using the `mvn -Pnative -DskipTests package` command without running the `native-image` command as a separate step.
[TIP]
====
If Maven Surefire is using an older version of the JUnit Platform, you may experience some errors.
To solve this problem, we recommend using the following plugin:

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0</version>
</plugin>
----
====

The plugin figures out which JAR files it needs to pass to the native image and what the executable main class should be.
If the heuristics fail with the `no main manifest attribute, in target/<name>.jar` error, the main class should be
specified in the `<configuration>` node of the plugin.
When `mvn -Pnative package` completes, an executable is ready for use, generated in the `target` directory of the project.

NOTE: Building native image without attaching to the `package` phase can be done by invoking the forking `compile` goal directly, e.g. `mvn native:compile`

[TIP]
.Testing pre-releases
====
You can use development versions of the plugin by adding our snapshot repository. Pre-releases are provided for convenience, without any guarantee.
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]

[[configuration-options]]
== Configuration

[[native-image-options]]
=== Native image options

If you use Native Image Maven plugin, it will pick up all the configuration for your
application stored below the `META-INF/native-image/` resource location, as described in
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/BuildConfiguration/[Native Image
Build Configuration]. It is also possible to customize the plugin within a
`<configuration>` node. The following configuration options are available.

`<mainClass>`::
   If the execution fails with the `no main manifest attribute, in target/<name>.jar`
   error, the main class should be specified. By default the plugin consults several
   locations in the `pom.xml` file in the following order to determine what the main class
   of the image should be.
      * `<maven-shade-plugin> <transformers> <transformer> <mainClass>`
      * `<maven-assembly-plugin> <archive> <manifest> <mainClass>`
      * `<maven-jar-plugin> <archive> <manifest> <mainClass>`
`<imageName>`::
   Use `<imageName>` to set a custom filename for the generated native image. If a custom
   image name is not supplied, the artifact ID of the project will be used by default.
`<buildArgs>`::
   If you want to pass additional arguments to the native image builder, use `<buildArgs>`
   in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<buildArgs>
    <buildArg>--argument</buildArg>
</buildArgs>
----
`<skipNativeBuild>`::
   To skip generation of the native image, supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<skipNativeBuild>true</skipNativeBuild>
----
`<skipNativeTests>`::
   To skip generation and execution of the native image compiled tests, supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<skipNativeTests>true</skipNativeTests>
----
`<debug>`::
   If you want to enable generation of debugging information supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<debug>true</debug>
----
`<verbose>`::
   If you want to enable verbose output during native-image building supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<verbose>true</verbose>
----
`<sharedLibrary>`::
   If you want to build image as a shared library supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<sharedLibrary>true</sharedLibrary>
----
`<useArgFile>`::
   If you want to use argument file for native-image building supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<useArgFile>true</useArgFile>
----
`<quickBuild>`::
   If you want to build the image using https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/overview/BuildOutput/#qbm-use-quick-build-mode-for-faster-builds[quick build mode], supply the following in the configuration of the plugin (alternatively set the `GRAALVM_QUICK_BUILD` environment variable to `true`):
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<quickBuild>true</quickBuild>
----

`<excludeConfig>`::
   In order to exclude configuration from present jar files, specify:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<excludeConfig>
    <entry>
        <jarPath>dummy/path/to/file.jar</jarPath>
        <resourcePattern>*</resourcePattern>
    </entry>
</excludeConfig>
----
`<environment>`::
   To set environment options for native-image building supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<environment>
    <variable>value</variable>
</environment>
----
`<systemPropertyVariables>`::
   To specify system properties used for native-image building supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<systemPropertyVariables>
    <propertyName>value</propertyName>
</systemPropertyVariables>
----
`<jvmArgs>`::
   To specify JVM arguments used for native-image building supply the following in the configuration of the plugin:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<jvmArgs>
    <arg>argument1</arg>
    <arg>argument2</arg>
</jvmArgs>
----
`<classpath>`::
   Sets a custom classpath instead of plugin generated one. Usage:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<classpath>
    <param>path/to/file.jar</param>
    <param>path/to/classes</param>
</classpath>
----
`<classesDirectory>`::
   If you want to specify custom path to packed JAR, or a custom directory that contains
only application classes, but want the plugin to still automatically add classpath entries for
dependencies, simply add:
[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<classesDirectory>
    path/to/dir
</classesDirectory>
----
`<agent>`::
   Configuration of the <<agent-support, native agent>>. See <<agent-support-enabling>>
   and <<agent-support-configuring-options>> for details.

For example, to build a native image named `executable-name` that uses
`org.example.ClassName` as its main class with assertions enabled, add the following
`<configuration>` block for the `native-maven-plugin`.

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<configuration>
  <imageName>executable-name</imageName>
  <mainClass>org.example.ClassName</mainClass>
  <fallback>false</fallback>
  <verbose>true</verbose>
</configuration>
----

NOTE: Most of the aforementioned properties can also be set from command line as a part of Maven invocation -- for example if you want to temporarily enable verbose mode you can append `-Dverbose` to your Maven invocation.

NOTE: If you use GraalVM Enterprise as the `JAVA_HOME` environment, the plugin builds a native image with enterprise features enabled -- for example, an executable will automatically be built with https://medium.com/graalvm/isolates-and-compressed-references-more-flexible-and-efficient-memory-management-for-graalvm-a044cc50b67e[compressed references] and other optimizations enabled.

[[agent-support]]
=== Reflection support and running with the native agent

If your project requires reflection, classpath resources, dynamic proxies or other
features requiring explicit native configuration, it may prove helpful to first run your
application or tests using the
https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/[`native-image-agent`].

The Native Image Maven plugin simplifies generation of the required configuration files by
injecting the agent automatically for you (this includes, but is not limited to the
reflection file).

The agent generates the native configuration files in subdirectories of
`target/native/agent-output`. Although those files will be automatically used if you run
your build with the agent enabled, you should consider reviewing the generated files and
adding them to your sources instead.

[[agent-support-enabling]]
==== Enabling the agent

The agent is disabled by default, but it can be enabled within your `pom.xml` file or via
the command line.

To enable the agent by default, specify `<enabled>true</enabled>` as follows in the
configuration of the `native-maven-plugin` in your POM.

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
```xml
<configuration>
  <agent>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
  </agent>
</configuration>
```

To enable the agent via the command line, supply the `-Dagent=true` flag when running
Maven. The examples in the following sections demonstrate how to do this for your
application and for tests.

[TIP]
====
If you have enabled the agent within your POM, you can still disable it via the command
line by supplying the `-Dagent=false` flag.
====

[[agent-support-configuring-options]]
==== Configuring agent options

If you would like to configure the options for the agent -- for example, to configure
agent mode or advanced features
such as
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/#caller-based-filters[Caller-based Filters]
and https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/#access-filters[Access Filters]
- you can specify them in your POM as described bellow.

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../snippets/maven/pom.xml[tag=native-plugin-agent-configuration]

This example shows all possibilities you can use for native agent configuration. If you don't need some of the options,
just remove them.

Agent can be run in one of the following modes:

* `standard` - in this mode you run agent only with options provided in `options` section.
* `direct` - in this mode you can provide command line that you want to be executed as an agent configuration. In this
     mode, user is fully responsible for agent configuration, and the rest of the agent configuration, provided in pom.xml file, will be ignored.
* `conditional` - in this mode you can provide additional files that can be used as a filter for the agent output. You
can read more about conditional mode https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/ExperimentalAgentOptions/[here].

Here is an explanation for each option you can specify in the agent block:

* `enabled` - a simple flag that specifies whether the agent is enabled or not. Can be set to true or false.
* `defaultMode` - agent mode switcher. Can be set to: standard, direct or conditional.
* `modes` - list of additional mode options, specific for certain mode type. Inside this tag, you can specify options for
 direct or conditional modes. Standard mode doesn't have any specific options.
  ** in case of `direct` mode you can specify `<direct>` tag, with the agent command line as its value
  ** in case of `conditional` mode you can specify `<conditional>` tag, and set additional https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/blob/master/docs/CollectingMetadata.md[filter files]
   inside `<userCodeFilterPath>` and `<extraCodeFilterPath>`. Also, you can set value for `<parallel>` tag. If the value is true, agent will create
   partial-config file, and merge it with conditional merge, otherwise agent will generate same kind of output as other modes.
* `options` - list of options that can be specify independent from agent mode. More about common options can be found
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/[here].

[[agent-support-running-tests]]
==== Running tests with the agent

The simplest way to use the agent is to do it via execution of your tests.

Run your test suite with:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
```bash
mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true test
```

When the `agent` system property is set to `true` (or when the agent is
<<agent-support-enabling, enabled in the POM>>), the agent will be automatically attached
to your Maven Surefire test execution, and the generated files can be found in the
`target/native/agent-output/test` directory.

[TIP]
====
If you want to run metadataCopy as well, first define its configuration as described <<metadata-copy, above>> and add `native:metadata-copy`
at the end of the agent invocation command. Example:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
```bash
mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true test native:metadata-copy
```
====

[[agent-support-running-application]]
==== Running your application with the agent

Executing your application with the agent is more involved and requires you to configure a
separate mojo execution which allows forking the Java process.

In your `native` Maven profile section, add the following:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-reflection/pom.xml[tag=java-agent-exec]

Then you can execute your application with the agent by running:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
```bash
mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true -DskipTests -DskipNativeBuild=true package exec:exec@java-agent
```

Both of the above commands will generate configuration files in the
`target/native/agent-output/main` directory. If you want to run your native application
with those configuration files, you then need to execute the following command:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
```bash
mvn -Pnative -Dagent=true -DskipTests package exec:exec@native
```

[[agent-filter-file]]
==== Reduce the amount of generated metadata

In some cases agent may include more metadata than it is actually needed. You can filter metadata using the agent filter files.
These filter files that agent consumes have the following structure:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
 "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "some.class.to.include.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "some.class.to.exclude.**"},
  ],
  "regexRules": [
    {"includeClasses": "regex\.example\.class.*"},
    {"excludeClasses": "regex\.example\.exclude[0-9]+"},
  ]
}
----

The process how you can pass the config files to the agent is described in the <<agent-support-configuring-options,previous section>>.

We can see on the <<example, example>> how different filter files affect generated metadata.
Let's start with the simple filter file:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "**"}
  ]
}
----

This filter file will instruct the agent to include everything, which will result in a massive configuration file.
For example this is how `reachability-metadata.json` looks like:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----

        },
        {

        },
        {
          "name": "threadContentionMonitoringSupport"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

As you can see, there are lots of entries that you likely don't want.
They are present because the metadata was generated using tests, for example, and that the testing library was present at runtime during the agent execution pass, but in practice, your application will not use the testing library in production.
To reduce the amount of generated metadata, we will use the following `user-code-filter.json`:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "org.apache.maven.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "org.junit.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "java.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "jdk.internal.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "sun.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "com.sun.**"}
  ]
}
----

[WARNING]
====
Always be careful when removing entries in metadata, as this may result in a broken binary
====

After updating our filters, we can regenerate the metadata, which will result in the following `reachability-metadata.json` file:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "reflection": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "typeReached": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      "type": "org.example.NativeTests$Person",
      "allDeclaredFields": true
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "typeReached": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      "glob": "TestResource.txt"
    }
  ],
  "bundles": []
}
----

As you can see there are no more entries that contain classes from `org.apache.maven` (as their condition).

[[metadata-copy]]
==== Metadata copy
`metadataCopy` provides additional options for manipulating the agent output after agent finishes its job.

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../snippets/maven/metadataCopy.xml[tag=native-plugin-agent-metadata-copy]

You can set values for the following tags:

* `<outputDirectory>` - where you want to copy agent output.
* `<merge>` - in case you already have some other config files inside `output directory`, you can choose whether you want to override those files or
    merge new files with the existing once (set merge value to true).
* `<disabledStages>` - in case you don't want to copy output of the certain stage (main or test) you can disable them and metadataCopy will not look at
    the agent output for that stage. For example, if you want to copy only config files generated in tests, you can disable main stage. Also, if you want
    to copy only files generated in main phase, you can disable test stage. Therefore, if you skip both stages, metadataCopy will not be executed.


[[configuration-reusing-config-from-parent]]
== Reusing configuration from a parent POM

The `<buildArgs>` element can be combined between parent and children POMs. Suppose you have the following parent POM definition:

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
  <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${current_plugin_version}</version>
  <configuration>
    <imageName>${project.artifactId}</imageName>
    <mainClass>${exec.mainClass}</mainClass>
    <buildArgs>
      <buildArg>--no-fallback</buildArg>
    </buildArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

Children projects have the ability to append `<buildArg>` arguments in the following way:

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
  <artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <buildArgs combine.children="append">
      <buildArg>--verbose</buildArg>
    </buildArgs>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

In this case, the arguments that will be passed to the `native-image` executable will be:

[source,shell, role="multi-language-sample"]
```shell
--no-fallback --verbose
```

[[testing-support]]
== Testing support

This plugin supports running tests on the
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[JUnit Platform] as native images. This
means that tests will be compiled and executed as native code.

NOTE: The minimum supported version is JUnit 5.8.1 (JUnit Platform 1.8.1, JUnit Jupiter 5.8.1, JUnit Vintage 5.8.1)

In theory, any `TestEngine` supported on the JUnit Platform should be supported by this
plugin as long as the programming language used by the `TestEngine` and the programming
language used to write the tests is supported in a GraalVM native image. This plugin
provides explicit support for the JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage test engines, and
support for additional test engines should be possible with custom native configuration.

In order to use the recommended JUnit Platform test listener mode, you need to enable
extensions for the `native-maven-plugin` by adding `<extensions>true</extensions>` as follows.

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-tests/pom.xml[tag=native-plugin-extensions]

Running `mvn -Pnative test` will then build and run native tests.

[[testing-support-version-compatibility]]
=== Version compatibility

This plugin requires Maven Surefire 2.22.0 or higher to run tests within a native image.

Each version of the Maven Surefire plugin has a dependency on a particular version of the
JUnit Platform. You therefore need to ensure that Maven Surefire is using at least version
1.8 of the JUnit Platform. Beginning with version 3.0 M4, Maven Surefire will
automatically align the JUnit Platform version used by Surefire with the version needed by
the user's configured version of JUnit Jupiter or JUnit Vintage. Since the examples in
this document use Maven Surefire 3.0 M5, their maven POMs do not require any special
configuration regarding the JUnit Platform version. However, if you are using a version of
Maven Surefire prior to 3.0 M4 you will need to add an explicit dependency on the
`junit-platform-launcher` artifact to the `dependencies` section of your `native` profile
configuration as in the following example.

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.junit.platform</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit-platform-launcher</artifactId>
		<version>1.8.2</version>
		<scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
----

TIP: If you have imported the `junit` BOM or are using a plugin that manages JUnit
versions for you -- for example, Spring Boot -- you may want to omit the `<version>`
configuration in the above example.

If Maven Surefire is using an older version of the JUnit Platform, the build will fail
with an error similar to the following when attempting to run tests in a native image.

----
[ERROR] Test configuration file wasn't found. Make sure that test execution wasn't skipped.
----

[[testing-support-disabling]]
=== Disabling testing support

If you wish to disable tests on the JVM as well as tests within a native image, you can
invoke Maven with the `-DskipTests` flag. This flag is supported by Maven Surefire and
Native Build Tools. Several examples in <<agent-support-running-application>> demonstrate
the use of this flag.

If you wish to run tests on the JVM with Maven Surefire but skip testing within a native
image, you can invoke Maven with the `-DskipNativeTests` flag. This flag is specific to
Native Build Tools. For example, you might wish to disable only native testing support for
use cases such as the following:

- You don't actually want to run your tests in native mode.
- Your library or application uses a testing framework that is not supported on the JUnit
  Platform.
- You need to use the <<agent-support, agent>> when running tests on the JVM but do not
  wish to run those same tests in native mode.

[[long_classpath_and_shading_support]]
== Long classpath, @argument file and shading support

Under Windows, https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools/issues/85[it is possible that the length of the classpath exceeds what the operating system supports] when invoking the CLI to build a native image.

To avoid this, since release 0.9.10, the plugin will use an argument file to pass the arguments to the `native-image` tool, instead of passing them directly.

There is also a `native:write-args-file` goal that can be used to generate this argument file. This can be useful in situations where the Native Build Tools plugin is not available, for example, when running native-image in a Docker container. The path to the args file is stored in the project properties
under the key `graalvm.native-image.args-file`, so that other Maven plugins further in the lifecycle can use it.

In case you are using a GraalVM version older than 21.3, you will however have to use a workaround, since the argument file wasn't supported.

One option is to use a https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin[shaded jar] and use it instead of individual jars on classpath.

First, you'll need to setup the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin[Maven Shade plugin]:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application/pom.xml[tag=shade-plugin]

If you need testing support, add the JUnit Platform Native dependency explicitly:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-tests/pom.xml[tag=junit-platform-native-dependency]

Then the native plugin needs to be configured to use this jar instead of the full classpath:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application/pom.xml[tag=native-plugin]


Depending on the other plugins your build uses (typically the Spring Boot plugin), you might have to configure, in addition, the main class:

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
	<artifactId>native-maven-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>${native.buildtools.version}</version>
	<configuration>
		<imageName>${project.artifactId}</imageName>
		<mainClass>${exec.mainClass}</mainClass>
		<buildArgs>
			<buildArg>--no-fallback</buildArg>
		</buildArgs>
		<classpath>
			<param>
				${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-shaded.jar
			</param>
		</classpath>
...
----

To be able to <<testing-support,execute tests in native mode>>, you will need more setup:

- Create a `src/assembly/test-jar-with-dependencies.xml` file with the following contents:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-tests/src/assembly/test-jar-with-dependencies.xml[tag=assembly]

- Add the assembly plugin to your `native` profile:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-tests/pom.xml[tag=assembly-plugin]

- Due to a limitation in Maven, you will need to move the tests execution to the "integration-test" phase:

[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-tests/pom.xml[tag=native-plugin]

Finally, you will need to execute tests using the `integration-test` phase instead of `test`:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
```bash
./mvn -Pnative integration-test
```

Please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin[Maven Shade plugin documentation] for more details on how to configure shading and the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin[Maven Assembly plugin documentation] to tweak what to include in tests.

[[metadata-support]]
== GraalVM Reachability Metadata Support

The plugin adds support for the https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/[GraalVM reachability metadata repository].
This repository provides https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/[reachability metadata] for libraries that do not support GraalVM Native Image.

[NOTE]
====
This version of the plugin defaults to the using the metadata repository in version {metadata-repository-version}. There is nothing for you to configure if you are fine with this version. The repository is also published on Maven Central at the following coordinates:

[source,xml, role="multi-language-sample"]
```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.graalvm.buildtools</groupId>
    <artifactId>graalvm-reachability-metadata</artifactId>
    <version>{maven-plugin-version}</version>
    <classifier>repository</classifier>
    <type>zip</type>
</dependency>
```
e.g. `graalvm-reachability-metadata-{maven-plugin-version}-repository.zip`.
====

=== Configuring the metadata repository

Metadata repository is enabled by default. Support can be disabled by including the following into the `<configuration>` element:

.Disabling the metadata repository
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/metadata-repo-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-disable]
----

Alternatively, you can use a _remote repository_, in which case you can specify the URL of the ZIP file:

.Enabling a remote repository
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/native-config-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-url]
----

For debugging purposes you can use a local repository:

.Enabling a local repository
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/native-config-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-local]
----

[NOTE]
The local path can point to an _exploded_ directory, or to a compressed ZIP file.

For each library included in the native image, the plugin will automatically search for GraalVM image build configuration metadata in the repository that was released together with the plugin.
In case you want to use another version of the metadata use:

.Choosing a version for the metadata repository
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/metadata-repo-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-versioned]
----


In some cases, you may need to exclude a particular module from the search.
This can be done by configuring that particular dependency:

.Excluding a module from search
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/native-config-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-exclude]
----

Last, it is possible for you to override the _metadata version_ of a particular module.
This may be interesting if there's no specific metadata available for the particular version of the library that you use, but that you know that a version works:

.Specifying the metadata version to use for a particular library
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/native-config-integration/pom.xml[tag=metadata-force-version]
----

=== Adding metadata repository files

By default, repository metadata will be used only when your native image is generated.
In some situations, you may want to include the metadata directly inside your jar.

Adding metadata to your jar can be useful when some other process is responsible for converting your jar into a native image.
For example, you might be generating a shaded jar and using a https://paketo.io/[Paketo buildpack] to convert it to a native image.

To include metadata repository inside your jar you can use the `add-reachability-metadata` goal.
Typically the goal will be included in an execution step where by default it will be bound to the `generate-resources` phase:

.Configuring the `add-reachability-metadata` goal to execute with the `generate-resources` phase
[source,xml, indent=0, role="multi-language-sample"]
