== Introduction

The {doctitle} adds support for building and testing native images using the https://gradle.org[Gradle build tool].

For upgrading please take a look at the <<changelog,changes section>>.

== Quickstart

=== Adding the plugin

Add following to `plugins` section of your project's `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts`:

.Applying the plugin
[subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
plugins {
  // ...

  // Apply GraalVM Native Image plugin
  id 'org.graalvm.buildtools.native' version '{gradle-plugin-version}'
}
```

[subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
plugins {
  // ...

  // Apply GraalVM Native Image plugin
  id("org.graalvm.buildtools.native") version "{gradle-plugin-version}"
}
```

The plugin isn't available on the https://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin Portal] yet, so you will need to declare a plugin repository in addition:

Add the following to your `settings.gradle` / `settings.gradle.kts`:

[role="multi-language-sample"]
.Declaring the plugin repository
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/settings.gradle[tags=plugin-management]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/settings.gradle.kts[tags=plugin-management]

```

[TIP]
.Testing pre-releases
====
You can use the development versions of the plugin by adding our snapshot repository instead. Pre-releases are provided for convenience, without any guarantee.

=== Installing GraalVM native image tool

The plugin relies on Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/7.1.1/userguide/toolchains.html[JVM toolchain support], allowing to decorrelate the tool used to run Gradle, the compiler used to build your application, and eventually the SDK used to generate a native image.

In practice, it means that this plugin will try to locate a suitable installation of GraalVM for you, even if you don't run Gradle itself with GraalVM.
For this, it will look into conventional places on your machine, including from installations done by popular tools like https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!] or https://github.com/shyiko/jabba[Jabba].

WARNING: Even if you have a GraalVM SDK installed, Gradle will _not_ automatically detect if `native-image` is also installed.
Therefore, you will need to make sure that you have executed `gu install native-image` as indicated in the <<graalvm-setup.adoc#,setup instructions>>.

If Gradle cannot find a GraalVM installation on the machine, it will fail with an error like this:

```
   > No compatible toolchains found for request filter: {languageVersion=11, vendor=matching('GraalVM'), implementation=vendor-specific} (auto-detect true, auto-download true)
```

This happens because there's no automatic provisioning of the GraalVM toolchain available yet, so you will have to install it first.
Follow the <<graalvm-setup.adoc#,following instructions>> to install it properly.

Eventually, you also have the options to:

1. <<disabling-toolchains,Disabling toolchain support>>
2. Run Gradle itself with a GraalVM SDK
3. Setup a `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable pointing to your GraalVM installation

Note that none of those options are recommended as they are more fragile.

== Configuration

This plugin works with the `application` plugin and will register a number of tasks and extensions for you to configure.

=== Available tasks

The main tasks that you will want to execute are:

- `nativeCompile`, which will trigger the generation of a native executable of your application
- `nativeRun`, which executes the generated native executable
- `nativeTestCompile`, which will build a native image with tests found in the `test` source set
- `nativeTest`, which will <<testing,execute tests>> found in the `test` source set in native mode

Those tasks are configured with reasonable defaults using the `graalvmNative` extension `binaries` container of type link:javadocs/native-gradle-plugin/org/graalvm/buildtools/gradle/dsl/NativeImageOptions.html[NativeImageOptions].

The main executable is configured by the image named `main`, while the test executable is configured via the image named `test`.

=== Native image options

The link:javadocs/native-gradle-plugin/org/graalvm/buildtools/gradle/dsl/NativeImageOptions.html[NativeImageOptions] allows you to tweak how the native image is going to be built.

==== Selecting the GraalVM toolchain

By default, the plugin will select a Java 11 GraalVM toolchain.
If you want to use a different toolchain, for example a GraalVM Community Edition for Java 8, you can configure the toolchain like this:

.Selecting the GraalVM toolchain
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=select-toolchain]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=select-toolchain]
```

[[disabling-toolchains]]
==== Disabling toolchain detection

Because of limitations in Gradle, the plugin may not be able to properly detect the toolchain.
This is the case if, for example, you want to use GraalVM Enterprise or that you want to be able to select a particular version of GraalVM.

To workaround this problem, you can disable toolchain detection:

.Disabling toolchain detection
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=disabling-toolchain, indent=0]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=disabling-toolchain, indent=0]
```

If you do this, the plugin will search for 2 environment variables: `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` _in that order_.
If one of them is set, it will assume that it points to a valid GraalVM installation and completely bypass toolchain selection.
Therefore, it becomes your responsibility to make sure that the JDK pointing at this environment variable matches your build script requirements (in particular, the language version).

==== Configuration options

The following configuration options are available for building images:

.NativeImageOption configuration
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=all-config-options]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=all-config-options]
```

NOTE: For options that can be set using command-line, if both DSL and command-line options are present, command-line options take precedence.

[[long_classpath_and_fat_jar_support]]
==== Long classpath and fat jar support

Under Windows, https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools/issues/85[it is possible that the length of the classpath exceeds what the operating system supports] when invoking the CLI to build a native image.
As a consequence, if you are running under Windows, the plugin will automatically shorten the classpath of your project by building a so called "fat jar", which includes all entries from the classpath automatically.

In case this behavior is not required, you can disable the fat jar creation by calling:

.Disabling the fat jar creation
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=disable-fatjar]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=disable-fatjar]
```

Alternatively, it is possible to use your own fat jar (for example created using the https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/[Shadow plugin]) by setting the `classpathJar` property directly on the _task_:

.Disabling the fat jar creation
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=custom-fatjar]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-fatjar]
```

When the `classpathJar` property is set, the `classpath` property is _ignored_.

[[testing]]
=== Testing support

This plugin supports running JUnit Platform tests as native images.
In other words, tests will be compiled and executed as native code.

Currently, this feature requires the execution of the tests in the classic "JVM" mode _prior to_ the execution of tests in native mode. To execute the tests, execute:

```bash
./gradlew nativeTest
```

=== Reflection support and running with the native agent

If your project requires reflection, then https://docs.oracle.com/en/graalvm/enterprise/19/guide/reference/native-image/tracing-agent.html[`native-image-agent`] run might be necessary.

The Gradle plugin makes it easy to generate the required configuration files by injecting the agent automatically for you (this includes, but is not limited to the reflection file).

This should be as easy as appending `-Pagent` to `run` and `nativeBuild`, or `test` and `nativeTest` task invocations:

```bash
./gradlew -Pagent run # Runs on JVM with native-image-agent.
./gradlew -Pagent nativeCompile # Builds image using configuration acquired by agent.

# For testing
./gradlew -Pagent test # Runs on JVM with native-image-agent.
./gradlew -Pagent nativeTest # Builds image using configuration acquired by agent.
```

Same can be achieved by setting corresponding DSL option, althought this isn't recommended as this is a development mode feature only.

The generated configuration files will be found in the `${buildDir}/native/agent-output/${taskName}` directory, for example, `build/native/agent-output/run`.

=== Disabling test support

There are cases where you might want to disable test support:

- you don't actually want to run your tests in native mode
- your library or application uses another test framework than JUnit 5 (currently this plugin only supports testing with JUnit Platform 5.8+)

In this case, you can disable test support by configuring the `graalvmNative` extension:

.Disabling test support
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=disable-test-support]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=disable-test-support]
```

[[extra-test-suites]]
=== Configuring additional test suites

It's common to have multiple test source sets in a Gradle build.
Typically, you may have an integration test suite, or a functional test suite, in addition to the unit test suite.
The plugin supports running those tests as native binaries too.

For example, imagine that you have a source set named `integTest` and that its corresponding test task is named `integTest`.
In this case you can register a new native test binary via the `graalvmNative` extension:

.Registering a new test suite
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-custom-tests/build.gradle[tag=register-native-test]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-binary]
```

The plugin will then automatically create the following tasks:

- `nativeIntegTestCompile`, to compile a native image using the `integTest` source set
- `nativeIntegTest`, to execute the tests in native mode

The same mechanism can be used if you have multiple test tasks for a single test source set, which is often the case with manual test sharding.

[[plugin-configurations]]
=== Configurations defined by the plugin

For each binary (`main` and `test`), the plugin declares 2 configurations that users or plugin authors can use to tweak the native image compilation classpath:

- `nativeImageCompileOnly` (for the `main` binary) and `nativeImageTestCompileOnly` (for the `test` binary) can be used to declare dependencies which are only needed at image compilation.
- `nativeImageClasspath` (for the `main` binary) and `nativeImageTestClasspath` (for the `test` binary) are the configurations which are resolved to determine the image classpaths.

The native image "compile only" configurations can typically be used to declare dependencies which are only required when building a native binary, and therefore shouldn't leak to the classic "JVM" runtime.

For example, you could declare a source set which uses the GraalVM SDK to implement native features.
This source set would contain code which is only relevant to native images building:

.Declaring a custom source set
[role="multi-language-sample"]
```groovy
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-extra-sourceset/build.gradle[tag=extra-sourceset]
```

[role="multi-language-sample"]
```kotlin
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-extra-sourceset/build.gradle.kts[tag=extra-sourceset]
```
