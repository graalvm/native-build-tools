[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The {doctitle} adds support for building and testing native images using the https://gradle.org[Gradle build tool].

Find the differences between the versions in the <<changelog.adoc#,project changelog>>.

You can find sample applications in the https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools/tree/master/samples[source repository].

[[adding-the-plugin]]
== Adding the plugin

Add following to `plugins` section of the project's _build.gradle_ / _build.gradle.kts_ file:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
plugins {
  // ...

  // Apply GraalVM Native Image plugin
  id 'org.graalvm.buildtools.native' version '{gradle-plugin-version}'
}
----

[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="multi-language-sample"]
----
plugins {
  // ...

  // Apply GraalVM Native Image plugin
  id("org.graalvm.buildtools.native") version "{gradle-plugin-version}"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This plugin supplements and heavily relies on regular Java plugins such as `application`, `java-library`, `java`, and others. Not having them included in your project will most probably cause errors.
====

[TIP]
====
You can use development versions of the plugin by adding the snapshot repository instead. Pre-releases are provided for convenience, without any guarantee.

[[installing-graalvm]]
== Installing GraalVM

The plugin requires that you https://www.graalvm.org/latest/docs/getting-started/[install GraalVM].
The easiest way to install GraalVM is to use the https://sdkman.io/jdks[SDKMAN!].
For other installation options, go to https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/[GraalVM Downloads].

By default, the plugin attempts to use the `native-image` tool bundled with the JDK running Gradle. 
Therefore, you must ensure that Gradle runs on a GraalVM JDK.

You may choose to:

1. Set the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable to point to your GraalVM installation. When this variable is configured, the JDK specified at this location will be used for Native Image builds.
2. <<configuration-toolchains-enabling, Enable toolchain support>>.

[TIP]
====
Check out https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html[which Java versions are compatible with the Gradle version] you are using.
In case the Gradle version you are using is not compatible with the GraalVM version,
you can set up the `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable pointing to your GraalVM installation, and the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to some JDK that is compatible with the Gradle on your system.
====

[[configuration-toolchains]]
=== Using Gradle toolchains

[[configuration-toolchains-enabling]]
==== Enabling toolchain detection

Instead of relying on the JDK which is used to run Gradle, you can use the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html[Gradle toolchain support] to select a specific GraalVM installation.

However, because of limitations in Gradle, the plugin may not be able to properly detect the toolchain.
In particular, this will only work properly if you _only_ have GraalVM JDKs installed on the machine.
**Otherwise, Gradle will not be able to reliably detect GraalVM JDKs**, nor detect GraalVM distributions from different vendors.

Should you still want to enable toolchain support, you do it via the `graalvmNative` extension:

[source,groovy,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=enabling-toolchain, indent=0]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=enabling-toolchain, indent=0]
----

==== Selecting the GraalVM toolchain

By default, the plugin will select a Java 11 GraalVM toolchain using the vendor string `GraalVM`, which works properly for GraalVM up to version 22.3 included.
More recent versions of GraalVM do not have a specific version and are aligned with the language version they support.

If you want to use a different toolchain, for example, a distribution compatible with Java 20 from Oracle, you can configure the toolchain like this:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=select-toolchain]
----

[source,kotlin,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=select-toolchain]
----

Again, be aware that the toolchain detection _cannot_ distinguish between GraalVM JDKs and standard JDKs without Native Image support.
If you have both installed on the machine, Gradle may randomly pick one or the other.

[[configuration]]
== Plugin configuration

The plugin works with the `application` plugin and registers a number of tasks and extensions for you to configure.

[[available-tasks]]
=== Available tasks

The main tasks that you may want to execute are:

- `nativeCompile` triggers the generation of a native executable of your application
- `nativeRun` executes the generated native executable
- `nativeTestCompile` builds a native image with tests found in the `test` source set
- `nativeTest` <<testing-support,executes tests>> found in the `test` source set in native mode

Those tasks are configured with reasonable defaults using the `graalvmNative` extension `binaries` container of type link:javadocs/native-gradle-plugin/org/graalvm/buildtools/gradle/dsl/NativeImageOptions.html[NativeImageOptions].

The main executable is configured by the image named `main`, while the test executable is configured via the image named `test`.

[[configure-native-image]]
=== Native Image configuration

The link:javadocs/native-gradle-plugin/org/graalvm/buildtools/gradle/dsl/NativeImageOptions.html[NativeImageOptions] allows you to tweak how the native image is going to be built.
The plugin allows configuring the final binary, the <<test-binary-config,tests>> one, as well as apply options to both.

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
graalvmNative {
    binaries.main {
        // options for the main binary
    }
    binaries.test {
        // options for the test binary
    }
    binaries.all {
        // common options for both main and test binaries
    }
}
----

The following configuration options are available for building native images:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=all-config-options]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=all-config-options]
----

[[native-image-options]]
==== Native Image options

- `imageName` - The name of the native executable, defaults to the project name
- `mainClass` - The main class to use, defaults to the _application.mainClass_
- `debug` - Determines if debug info should be generated; defaults to `false` (alternatively, add `--debug-native` to the CLI)
- `verbose` - Adds verbose output (`false` by default)
- `fallback` - Sets the fallback mode of `native-image` (`false` by default)
- `sharedLibrary` - Determines if the image is a shared library
- `quickBuild` - Determines if the image is being built in quick build mode
- `richOutput` - Determines whether `native-image` building should produce a rich output
- `systemProperties`: Defines the system properties to use for the `native-image` tool
- `configurationFileDirectories`: Adds a directory containing configuration files for `native-image`, such as reflection configuration
 -`excludeConfig`: Excludes configuration that matches any of the specified regex patterns from the JAR of a dependency with the given coordinates
- `jvmArgs`: Passes the specified arguments directly to the JVM running the `native-image` builder
- `useFatJar`: Builds a fat JAR instead of passing each JAR individually

You can also pass **build-time** and **run-time** arguments:

- `buildArgs.add('<buildArg>')`: Configures the build by passing options directly to `native-image`. You can pass any Native Image build option listed https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/overview/Options/[here].
- `runtimeArgs.add('<runtimeArg>')`: Specifies runtime arguments consumed by your application.

[NOTE]
====
For options that can be set using the command line, if both DSL and command-line options are present, command-line options take precedence.
====

[[native-image-tracing-agent]]
==== Native Image Tracing Agent

If your project requires reflection, classpath resources, dynamic proxies, or other features that need explicit configuration, it may be helpful to first run your application or tests using the https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/[Native Image Tracing Agent].

The Native Image Gradle plugin simplifies generation of the required metadata files by injecting the agent automatically for you (this includes, but is not limited to the reflection file).

Any task that extends `JavaForkOptions` (such as `test`, `run`, and so on) can be instrumented by passing `-Pagent` to Gradle when running those tasks.

Enable the agent by adding the following block inside `graalvmNative`:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled = true
}
----

[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled.set(true)
}
----

You can then run it:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew -Pagent run # Runs on HotSpot with the agent
----

The generated configuration files can be found in the `${buildDir}/native/agent-output/${taskName}` directory, for example, _build/native/agent-output/run_.
The plugin also substitutes `{output_dir}` in the agent options to point to this directory during the agent run.

The agent can run in multiple modes that dictate how the metadata is collected and merged.

* `defaultMode` - Specifies the default agent mode if one isn't specified using `-Pagent=mode_name`
* `enabled` - Enables the agent
* `modes`- Configures the following agent modes:
    ** `standard` - Generates metadata without conditions
    ** `conditional` - Generates metadata with conditions
        *** `userCodeFilterPath` - Path to a filter file that specifies which classes to include in metadata conditions
        *** `extraFilterPath` - (Optional) An additional filter file to further refine the collected metadata
    ** `direct` - Allows users to directly pass options to the agent
        *** `{output_dir}` -  The output directory to store agent files
* `tasksToInstrumentPredicate` - By default, when `-Pagent` is specified, all tasks extending `JavaForkOptions` are instrumented.
This can be limited to only specific tasks that match this predicate.

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled = true
    defaultMode = "conditional"
    modes {
        conditional {
            userCodeFilterPath = "src/test/native-image/filters/user-code-filter.json"
        }
        direct {
            options.add("config-output-dir=src/test/resources/direct-mode-metadata")
            options.add("experimental-configuration-with-origins")
        }
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled.set(true)
    defaultMode.set("conditional")
    modes {
        conditional {
            userCodeFilterPath.set("src/test/native-image/filters/user-code-filter.json")
        }
        direct {
            options.add("config-output-dir=src/test/resources/direct-mode-metadata")
            options.add("experimental-configuration-with-origins")
        }
    }
}
----

If you want to **enable the agent on the command line**, you can specify in which mode you want to run it. For example:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew -Pagent=standard nativeTest
./gradlew -Pagent=conditional nativeTest
./gradlew -Pagent=direct nativeTest
----

==== MetadataCopy task

Once the metadata is collected, it can be copied into the project using the `metadataCopy` task.
To do so, add the following block inside your `agent` block:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled = true
    metadataCopy {
        inputTaskNames.add("test")
        outputDirectories.add("src/test/resources/META-INF/native-image/org.example")
        mergeWithExisting = false
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    enabled.set(true)
    metadataCopy {
        inputTaskNames.add("test")
        outputDirectories.add("resources/META-INF/native-image/org.example")
        mergeWithExisting.set(false)
    }
}
----

Inside this block, you configure:

- `inputTaskNames` - specifies tasks previously executed with the agent attached (tasks that generated metadata in the last step).
- `outputDirectories` -  specifies the location where you want to copy the generated metadata
- `mergeWithExisting` - specifies whether the metadata you want to copy, should be merged with the metadata that already exists on the give location, or not. This only makes sense when there is already some existing metadata, created before.

Then you can copy metadata to the location you specified with:



[TIP]
====
You can configure the `metadataCopy` task on the command line as well:

[source,bash,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
./gradlew metadataCopy --task run  # if you used nativeRun (or just run) to collect metadata
./gradlew metadataCopy --task test  # if you used nativeTest (or just test) to collect metadata
./gradlew metadataCopy --dir <pathToSomeDirectory> # to specify the output directory
----
====

[[common-agent-options]]
==== Common agent options

All the mentioned modes share certain common configuration options like:

- `callerFilterFiles`
- `accessFilterFiles`
- `builtinCallerFilter`
- `builtinHeuristicFilter`
- `enableExperimentalPredefinedClasses`
- `enableExperimentalUnsafeAllocationTracing`
- `trackReflectionMetadata`

[WARNING]
====
These options are for advanced usages. You can read more about them https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/AutomaticMetadataCollection/#agent-advanced-usage[here].
====

A complete example of the agent block should look like this:

[source,groovy,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    defaultMode = "standard"
    enabled = true

    modes {
        conditional {
            userCodeFilterPath = "path-to-filter.json"
            extraFilterPath = "path-to-another-filter.json"
        }
        direct {
            options.add("config-output-dir={output_dir}")
            options.add("experimental-configuration-with-origins")
        }
    }

    callerFilterFiles.from("filter.json")
    accessFilterFiles.from("filter.json")
    builtinCallerFilter = true
    builtinHeuristicFilter = true
    enableExperimentalPredefinedClasses = false
    enableExperimentalUnsafeAllocationTracing = false
    trackReflectionMetadata = true

    metadataCopy {
        inputTaskNames.add("test")
        outputDirectories.add("src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/<groupId>/<artifactId>/")
        mergeWithExisting = true
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
agent {
    defaultMode.set("standard")
    enabled.set(true)

    modes {
        conditional {
            userCodeFilterPath.set("path-to-filter.json")
            extraFilterPath.set("path-to-another-filter.json")
        }
        direct {
            options.add("config-output-dir={output_dir}")
            options.add("experimental-configuration-with-origins")
        }
    }

    callerFilterFiles.from("filter.json")
    accessFilterFiles.from("filter.json")
    builtinCallerFilter.set(true)
    builtinHeuristicFilter.set(true)
    enableExperimentalPredefinedClasses.set(false)
    enableExperimentalUnsafeAllocationTracing.set(false)
    trackReflectionMetadata.set(true)

    metadataCopy {
        inputTaskNames.add("test")
        outputDirectories.add("src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/<groupId>/<artifactId>/")
        mergeWithExisting.set(true)
    }
}
----

[[agent-filter-file]]
==== Reduce the amount of generated metadata

In some cases the agent may include more metadata than it is actually needed.
You can filter metadata using the agent filter files.
These filter files that agent consumes have the following structure:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
 "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "some.class.to.include.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "some.class.to.exclude.**"},
  ],
  "regexRules": [
    {"includeClasses": "regex\.example\.class.*"},
    {"excludeClasses": "regex\.example\.exclude[0-9]+"},
  ]
}
----

The process how you can pass the config files to the agent is described in the <<additional-agent-options,previous section>>.

You can see on some simple Java application how different filter files affect generated metadata.

Let's start with this filter:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "**"}
  ]
}
----

This filter instructs the agent to include everything, which will result in a massive configuration file.
For example, this is how _reachability-metadata.json_ looks like:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  {
    "reflection": [
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "java.io.ObjectInputStream"
        },
        "type": "[Ljava.lang.Object;"
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "java.io.ObjectInputStream"
        },
        "type": "java.util.LinkedHashSet"
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "org.gradle.api.internal.tasks.testing.junitplatform.JUnitPlatformTestClassProcessor"
        },
        "type": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "org.junit.jupiter.engine.descriptor.ClassBasedTestDescriptor"
        },
        "type": "org.example.NativeTests",
        "allDeclaredFields": true
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "org.junit.jupiter.engine.descriptor.ExtensionUtils"
        },
        "type": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "resources": [
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherFactory"
        },
        "glob": "META-INF/services/org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine"
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "java.lang.ClassLoader"
        },
        "glob": "TestResource.txt"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "bundles": [],
    "jni": [
      {
        "condition": {
          "typeReached": "java.net.InetAddress"
        },
        "type": "java.lang.Boolean",
        "methods": [
          {
            "name": "getBoolean",
            "parameterTypes": [
              "java.lang.String"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
----

As you can see, there are lots of entries that you likely do not want.
They are present because the metadata was generated using tests, and that the testing library was present at run time during the agent execution pass, but in practice, your application will not use the testing library in production.
To reduce the amount of generated metadata, use the following _user-code-filter.json_:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "rules": [
    {"includeClasses": "**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "org.junit.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "org.gradle.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "worker.org.gradle.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "org.slf4j.**"},
    {"excludeClasses": "java.**"}
  ]
}
----

[WARNING]
====
Always be careful when removing entries in metadata, as this may result in a broken native image.
====

After updating the filter, you can regenerate the metadata, which will result in the following _reachability-metadata.json_ file:

[source,json,subs="verbatim,attributes", role="multi-language-sample"]
----
{
  "reflection": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "typeReached": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      "type": "org.example.NativeTests$Person",
      "allDeclaredFields": true
    },
    {
      "condition": {
        "typeReached": "sun.security.jca.GetInstance"
      },
      "type": "sun.security.provider.SHA",
      "methods": [
        {
          "name": "<init>",
          "parameterTypes": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "typeReached": "org.example.NativeTests"
      },
      "glob": "TestResource.txt"
    }
  ],
  "bundles": []
}
----

As you can see there are no more entries that contain classes from `org.junit` (as their condition).

[[max_parallel_builds]]
==== Max parallel builds

When using Gradle parallel builds, the plugin automatically limits the number of native images which can be built concurrently, in order to limit CPU and memory usage.
By default, it is limited to the number of CPU cores / 16, but you can change this limit either by setting the `org.graalvm.buildtools.max.parallel.builds` gradle property (in your _gradle.properties_ file), or by setting the `GRAALVM_BUILDTOOLS_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILDS` environment variable.

[[configuration-advanced]]

[[long_classpath_and_fat_jar_support]]
==== Long classpath, @argument file, and fat JAR support

The plugin automatically passes arguments to the `native-image` tool from the argument file, which should prevent all https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools/issues/85[long classpath issues] under Windows.
However, if you are using an older GraalVM release (older than 21.3) which doesn't support argument files, you will need to rely on creating a "fat JAR", which includes all entries from the classpath automatically, to workaround the problem:

.Enabling the fat JAR creation
[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=enable-fatjar]
----

[source,kotlin,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=enable-fatjar]
----

Alternatively, it is possible to use your own JAR file (for example, created using the https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/[Shadow plugin]) by setting the `classpathJar` property directly on the _task_:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=custom-fatjar]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-fatjar]
----

When the `classpathJar` property is set, the `classpath` property is _ignored_.

[[testing-support]]
== Testing support

The plugin supports running tests on the
https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[JUnit Platform] as native images.
This means that tests are compiled and executed as native code.

[NOTE]
====
The minimum supported version is JUnit 5.8.1 (JUnit Platform 1.8.1, JUnit Jupiter 5.8.1, JUnit Vintage 5.8.1).
====

In theory, any `TestEngine` supported on the JUnit Platform should be supported by the plugin as long as the programming language used by the `TestEngine` and the programming language used to write the tests is supported by GraalVM Native Image.
The plugin provides explicit support for the JUnit Jupiter and JUnit Vintage test engines, and support for additional test engines should be possible with custom native configuration.

Currently, this feature requires the execution of the tests on the JVM _prior to_ the execution of tests as native code.
To execute the tests, run:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew nativeTest
----

[[test-binary-config]]
=== Configuring test image options

You can fine-tune the test binary using the `test` binary configuration.
The following example prints additional data for troubleshooting and sets the minimal optimizations.

[source,groovy,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=configure-test-binary]
----

[source,kotlin,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=configure-test-binary]
----

[[testing-support-disabling]]
=== Disabling testing support

There are cases where you might want to disable running native tests:

- You don't actually want to run your tests as native code.
- Your library or application uses a testing framework that is not supported on the JUnit Platform.
- You need to use the <<native-image-tracing-agent, agent>> when running tests on the JVM, but do not wish to run the same tests as native code.

In this case, you can disable native testing support by configuring the `graalvmNative` option as follows:

.Disabling testing support

----

[source,kotlin,role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=disable-test-support]
----

[[extra-test-suites]]
=== Configuring additional test suites

It is common to have multiple test source sets in a Gradle build.
Typically, you may have an integration test suite, or a functional test suite, in addition to the unit test suite.
The plugin supports running those tests as native binaries too.

For example, imagine that you have a source set named `integTest` and that its corresponding test task is named `integTest`.
In this case you can register a new native test binary with `graalvmNative`:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-custom-tests/build.gradle[tag=register-native-test]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-binary]
----

The plugin then automatically creates the following tasks:

- `nativeIntegTestCompile` to compile a native image using the `integTest` source set
- `nativeIntegTest` to execute the tests as native code

The same mechanism can be used if you have multiple test tasks for a single test source set, which is often the case with manual test sharding.

[[metadata-support]]
== GraalVM Reachability Metadata support

The plugin adds support for the https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata/[GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository].
This repository provides the https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/[configuration] for libraries that do not support GraalVM Native Image.

[NOTE]
====
The GraalVM Reachability Metadata Repository is also published on Maven Central at the following coordinates: `org.graalvm.buildtools:graalvm-reachability-metadata:graalvm-reachability-metadata` with the `repository` classifier and `zip` extension, for example, `graalvm-reachability-metadata-{gradle-plugin-version}-repository.zip`.
====

=== Configuring the metadata repository

The plugin automatically downloads the configuration metadata from the official repository if you supply the version of the repository you want to use.

The support is enabled by default, but can be disabled explicitly:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=disable-metadata-repository]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=disable-metadata-repository]
----

To override the repository version, use:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=specify-metadata-repository-version]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=specify-metadata-repository-version]
----

Alternatively, it is possible to use a _local repository_, in which case you can specify the path to the repository:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=specify-metadata-repository-file]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=specify-metadata-repository-file]
----

For each library dependency, the plugin automatically searches for the configuration metadata in the repository.
In some cases, you may need to exclude a particular module from the search.
This can be done by adding it to the exclude list:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=exclude-module-from-metadata-repo]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=exclude-module-from-metadata-repo]
----

Lastly, it is possible for you to override the _metadata version_ of a particular module.
This may be interesting if there is no specific metadata available for the particular version of the library that you use, but that you know that a version works:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=specify-metadata-version-for-library]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=specify-metadata-version-for-library]
----

=== Including metadata repository files

By default, reachability metadata is used only when your native image is being generated.
In some situations, you may want a copy of the reachability metadata to use it directly.

Copying the reachability metadata into the application JAR can be useful when some other process is responsible for converting your JAR into a native image.
For example, you might be generating a shaded JAR file and using a https://paketo.io/[Paketo buildpack] to convert it to a native image.

To download a copy of the metadata into the _build/native-reachability-metadata_ directory, you can the `collectReachabilityMetadata` task.
Files will be downloaded into `META-INF/native-image/<groupId>/<versionId>` subdirectories.

To include metadata repository inside the JAR file, you can link to the task using the `jar` DSL `from` directive:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/groovy/build.gradle[tags=include-metadata]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../snippets/gradle/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tags=include-metadata]
----

For more advanced configurations you can declare the `org.graalvm.buildtools.gradle.tasks.CollectReachabilityMetadata` task and set the appropriate properties.

[[pgo-support]]
== Profile-Guided Optimization

The plugin supports building images with https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/guides/optimize-native-executable-with-pgo/[Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)].

It works in 3 phases:

- the first one consists in generating a native image with instrumentation enabled
- the second phase consists in running the image in order to gather profiling information
- the third phase consists in creating an optimized native image based on the profiles

To generate a binary with instrumentation enabled, you should run the `nativeCompile` command with the `--pgo-instrument` command line option:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew nativeCompile --pgo-instrument
----

This generates a native image under _build/native/nativeCompile_ with the `-instrumented` suffix.
You can run this image to gather profiling data:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./my-app-instrumented
----

A _default.iprof_ file will be generated once the application is stopped.
Alternatively, you can have Gradle both generate and run the instrumented binary in a single command by running:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew nativeCompile --pgo-instrument nativeRun
----

In this case, the profile will automatically be stored under _build/native/nativeCompile_.

The last phase consists in copying the generated profile, so that it is automatically used when building an optimized native image.
The conventional location for profiles is _src/pgo-profiles/<name of the binary>_.
By default, the location will be _src/pgo-profiles/main_.
Copy _default.iprof_ into that directory, and then run:

[source,bash, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
./gradlew nativeCompile
----

The profile will automatically be used.
It is possible to include more than one profile, in which case you should rename the _.iprof_ files in the _src/pgo-profiles/main_ directory.

[[plugin-configurations]]
== Configurations defined by the plugin

For each binary (`main` and `test`), the plugin declares 2 configurations that users or plugin authors can use to tweak the native image compilation classpath:

- `nativeImageCompileOnly` (for the `main` binary) and `nativeImageTestCompileOnly` (for the `test` binary) can be used to declare dependencies which are only needed during the ahead-of-time compilation.
- `nativeImageClasspath` (for the `main` binary) and `nativeImageTestClasspath` (for the `test` binary) are the configurations which are resolved to determine the image classpath.

The native image "compile only" configurations can typically be used to declare dependencies which are only required when building a native binary, and therefore should not leak when running on the JVM.

For example, you can declare a source set which uses the GraalVM SDK to implement native features.
This source set would contain code which is only relevant to native images building:

[source, groovy, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-extra-sourceset/build.gradle[tag=extra-sourceset]
----

[source, kotlin, role="multi-language-sample"]
----
include::../../../../samples/java-application-with-extra-sourceset/build.gradle.kts[tag=extra-sourceset]
----
