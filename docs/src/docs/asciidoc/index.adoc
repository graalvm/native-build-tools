= Native Build Tools
The GraalVM team

The {doctitle} project provides plugins for various build tools, enabling support for building and testing native applications written in Java (or any other language compiled to JVM bytecode) using https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM  Native Image].
Currently, you can build your native applications using our Gradle or Maven plugins.

Each plugin takes metadata for available libraries from the https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata[GraalVM reachability metadata repository]
to provide better experience during the development of your native project.

If you are using alternative build systems, see <<alternative-build-systems.adoc#,Useful Hints for Alternative Build Systems>>.
