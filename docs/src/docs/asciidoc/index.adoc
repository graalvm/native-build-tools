= Native Build Tools
The GraalVM team

The {doctitle} project provides plugins for different build tools to add support for building and testing native applications written in Java (or any other language compiled to JVM bytecode).

Most notably, this is the official source for integrating with the https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/[GraalVM `native-image` tool].

Please refer to the following pages for build tool specific documentation:

- The <<gradle-plugin.adoc#,Gradle plugin documentation>>
- The <<maven-plugin.adoc#,Maven plugin documentation>>

If you are interested in contributing, please refer to our https://github.com/graalvm/native-build-tools[Git repository].
